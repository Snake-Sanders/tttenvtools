Consists of a static web page, generated using _erb_ and _rhtml_ templates. These pages are collected all the links and documents needed in daily basis.

Ideally the pages would be dynamically generated with _Sinatra_, however due to the simplicity of the pages it make sense to leave that feature for future extensions.

The source of the information that seeds the templates is a _JSON_ file. The _rhtml_ templates and _JSCON_ files are not part of this repository due to confidentiality.
