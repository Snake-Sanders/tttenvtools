Consists of a web page manually generated using erb templates were is collected all the links and documents needed daily.
Ideally using Sinatra is the main goal but since the simplicity of the page it make sense not to use a web server for the moment. All the pages are statically generated.
Some sections are generated based on information in a _json_ file.

The templates and json files are not part of this repository due to confidentiality.
